1. Linux Error “No such device” in call setsockopt when joining multicast group
Solution: check where the loopback is running using ifconfig.
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1
You need to use interface address as inet addr i.e. 127.0.0.1 

2. Anyhow by running chmod you are getting :
sudo: /etc/sudoers is world writable
sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting
sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin

Solution: If running wsl then open cmd and run-> wsl -u root
After that run-> chmod 440 /etc/sudoers
