1. Linux Error “No such device” in call setsockopt when joining multicast group
Solution: check where the loopback is running using ifconfig.
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1
You need to use interface address as inet addr i.e. 127.0.0.1 

2. Anyhow by running chmod you are getting :
sudo: /etc/sudoers is world writable
sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting
sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin

Solution: If running wsl then open cmd and run-> wsl -u root
After that run-> chmod 440 /etc/sudoers

3. Undefined referece error can be due to---
Mixing C with C++, Symbols defined in C called from C++:
C++ mangled names of functions and variables(Why: wiki). So the declaration of C functions in C++ becomes a bit tricky. And as the name of function/variable has changed in c++ file, The definition of function/variable will never be found hence linking error. Following is one example to do it in a proper way:
Let’s say we have a Method named void C_Method() and we want to use it in C++ file. So the Declaration on C++ should look like
extern “C” void C_Method()
Adding extern “C” tells compiler that this method belongs to C and don’t mangle it. But Wait what if you want entire header file to use? In that case, you have to extern complete header file like:

extern "C" {
    #include "your_c_header.h"
}

Also, there is one more way to if your C library is your own you can directly do following in your header:
//At the beginning of you header
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif
//and following at the end
#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
